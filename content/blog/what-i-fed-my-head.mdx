I read whatever was in front of me. That's the short version. The long version is that what was in front of me kept changing.

## Whatever Was Available

The earliest stuff was whatever showed up. Bookmobile books — if you didn't grow up with a bookmobile, it's a library in a bus that parks in your neighborhood because there isn't a real library nearby. You'd walk on, pick from what they had, and that was your week. I read everything on it that looked interesting, which was most of it.

The dictionary. I've written about this [elsewhere](/blog/how-i-got-here) — I read it like a novel, tracking how definitions looped back on each other. Latin and Greek roots before age four. The Bible at five.

Poetry came through Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss. The whimsy and humor of *Where the Sidewalk Ends*. The attitudes in Dr. Seuss — I remember being particularly affected by *The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins*, this kid who keeps trying to do the right thing and the world just keeps piling absurdity on him. Both of them took kids seriously without being serious about it.

## Choosing My Own

At some point I started picking for myself, and I went straight for fantasy. Dragonlance first — Weis and Hickman, the Chronicles trilogy, then Legends. Raistlin Majere was the first fictional character I truly identified with. Brilliant, bitter, physically weak, willing to sacrifice everything for power and then discovering that power wasn't the point. I was maybe ten.

Then Forgotten Realms. Drizzt Do'Urden — the dark elf who rejected the evil society he was born into and tried to live by a moral code nobody around him shared. That hit different when you're a kid who feels like the people around you aren't living up to what they say they believe.

Stephen King by thirteen. *It*, *The Stand*, *The Shining*, *Pet Sematary*. I'd read most of his library by sixteen. King gets something that a lot of literary writers don't — ordinary people in extraordinary situations will reveal exactly who they are. The horror isn't the monster. The horror is what people do when they're scared. I understood that early.

Sci-fi showed up too, mixed in. But fantasy and horror were home base. Stories where the world is broken and a small number of people have to decide whether to fix it.

## Final Fantasy as Moral Philosophy

The moral framework I was given at home was broad strokes. Protect the innocent. Cheer the underdog. Love thy neighbor. Big principles, very few specifics. Which meant I watched the adults around me nod along to those principles on Sunday and act like moral monsters the rest of the week. The gap between what people said and what people did was the first thing I learned to see clearly.

Final Fantasy filled in what the adults wouldn't.

Final Fantasy VI specifically. The world ends halfway through the game. The villain wins. Your party scatters. And then the second half is about finding each of them again, one by one, and convincing them — and yourself — that it's worth fighting even after you've already lost. That evil things happen in the world, and it's up to a few people with the gifts and the stubbornness to do something about it.

I was maybe twelve. I didn't have the vocabulary for it, but what that game taught me was that moral seriousness isn't about following rules. It's about showing up after the world breaks.

I carried that forward. Through every Final Fantasy after, through Chrono Trigger, through every story where a small group stands against something too big for them. It wasn't escapism. It was training.

## Where the Darkness Came From

My tolerance for darkness didn't come from books. My father died. My mother had mental health issues and made me a target. The kids around me bullied me, and none of them could possibly understand what I was dealing with when I went home at night. The books and games weren't where the darkness came from. They were where I learned it was survivable.

## The Nonfiction Era

After sixteen I was adrift. I got a job as a computer technician at a local appliances and electronics store in Albuquerque. Learned to fix things, talk to people, figure out what was actually wrong versus what someone said was wrong.

Then I helped open the first Apple Store in New Mexico. We trained for six weeks at another Apple Store and at Apple's facility in Elk Grove, California, just to prepare. I was there on opening day. Three years as a Mac Genius — five thousand issues resolved, trained two teams. I sold Mel Gibson his first iPhone. On iPhone launch day, I got one for free because I was helping customers troubleshoot theirs — the AT&T network actually went down shortly after launch because nobody anticipated the demand.

When the 2008 economic downturn hit, I was at the Apple Store in Colorado Springs. I quit to go back to school. Enrolled at Pikes Peak Community College for pre-med, thinking maybe psychiatry, maybe anesthesiology. Got a 4.0.

The reading during those years shifted completely. No more fantasy, no more horror. I was reading self-help, therapy books, anything that might explain what had happened to me and how to function anyway. *Understanding the Borderline Mother*. *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*. Three separate Nikola Tesla biographies. My nonfiction era. I was trying to reverse-engineer how to be a person.

## Musical Themes

My musical taste mirrored my psychological state with uncomfortable accuracy. In my teenage years I was into dark stuff. The kind of music that confirms that the world is as bad as you think it is. I won't catalog it — if you were a dark-leaning teenager in the late '90s, you know the playlist.

When I got into Stanford in 2011 — community college kid, full ride, twenty-eight years old starting as basically a sophomore alongside normal-aged freshmen and twenty-two-year-old transfers — the campus was playing Pink Floyd in common areas alongside that year's positive electronic pop. "We Are Young" by fun. was everywhere, and it hit me sideways because I wasn't young, not really, but I was starting over. A remix of Darude's "Sandstorm" showed up at a party and linked me back to a song I'd known in a completely different life. Dark Floyd and bright synths, coexisting in the same space, and something in me going: *oh, you can be both.*

Stanford was hard. I struggled to get through. But the musical bridge — dark to light, both at once, neither one a lie — tracked something real that was happening inside me. I came out the other side with a degree in philosophy and a sense that the darkness I'd lived in wasn't the whole picture. It was just the part I'd had access to.

## What I Was Reading in College

A little bit of Chinese. A lot of Java. Symbolic Systems as an academic home — psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and math all adding up to something bigger about how cognitive systems work in general.

I fell in love with Wittgenstein. Kant's ethics and his critique of formal mathematics. The philosophy of neuroscience — I was against Chalmers and for Dennett on consciousness. In one class I was the only person in the room who claimed we couldn't be sure any of us were conscious. Descartes had prepared me for this, but I took him further than he went. His Meditations doubt everything except consciousness — the evil demon can deceive you about the world, but not about the fact that you're thinking. My move was: what if consciousness itself is what the demon provides? What if the feeling of what it's like to be you is the illusion, not the proof? It confused my classmates. I think it's also one of the reasons my professor gave me an A+ — the only one I got at Stanford, where they are very hard to get and most professors don't offer them.

I got to argue with John Searle in person at a seminar about the Chinese Room experiment. I happened to be learning Chinese at the time. He told me I was wrong. I didn't flinch.

## What It Added Up To

I didn't have a curriculum. I had a bookmobile and a public library card and eventually an internet connection. I read what I read because it was there, or because it found me, or because I was desperate enough to need it.

All of that is still running. It just has a research program attached to it now.
