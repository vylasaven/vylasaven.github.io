I read whatever was in front of me. That's the short version. The long version is that what was in front of me kept changing.

## Whatever was available

The earliest stuff was whatever showed up. Bookmobile books — if you didn't grow up with a bookmobile, it's a library in a bus that parks in your neighborhood because there isn't a real library nearby. You'd walk on, pick from what they had, and that was your week. I read everything on it that looked interesting, which was most of it.

The dictionary. I've written about this [elsewhere](/blog/how-i-got-here) — I read it like a novel, tracking how definitions looped back on each other. Latin and Greek roots before age four. The Bible at five.

Poetry came through Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss. The whimsy and humor of *Where the Sidewalk Ends*. The attitudes in Dr. Seuss — I remember being particularly affected by *The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins*, this kid who keeps trying to do the right thing and the world just keeps piling absurdity on him. Both of them took kids seriously without being serious about it.

## Choosing my own

At some point I started picking for myself, and I went straight for fantasy. Dragonlance first — Weis and Hickman, the Chronicles trilogy, then Legends. I identified with Sturm Brightblade first, his sense of honor and justice. Later I came to appreciate Raistlin and his struggles against evil, his inherent sickness. I had febrile seizures until I was twelve and was always an active but fat and kind of sickly kid — Raistlin made sense to me in a way healthy characters didn't.

But the character I most connected with was Tanis. Half-elf, caught between two worlds, trying to hold a group of difficult people together. Being half Polish, told I was about an eighth Native American, feeling like an elf who read all the time and knew some kinds of magic — I didn't want to be Tanis. I felt like I already was, in some significant ways. Tanthalas Vylasaven was my online name for a while. And I wanted to marry Lauralanthalasa. I was maybe ten.

Then Forgotten Realms. Drizzt Do'Urden — the dark elf who rejected the evil society he was born into and tried to live by a moral code nobody around him shared. That hit different when you're a kid who feels like the people around you aren't living up to what they say they believe.

Stephen King by thirteen. *It*, *The Stand*, *The Shining*, *Pet Sematary*. I'd read most of his library by sixteen. King gets something that a lot of literary writers don't — ordinary people in extraordinary situations will reveal exactly who they are. The horror isn't the monster. The horror is what people do when they're scared. I understood that early.

Sci-fi showed up too, mixed in. But fantasy and horror were home base. Stories where the world is broken and a small number of people have to decide whether to fix it.

## Final Fantasy as moral philosophy

The moral framework I was given at home was broad strokes. Protect the innocent. Cheer the underdog. Love thy neighbor. Big principles, very few specifics. Which meant I watched the adults around me nod along to those principles on Sunday and act like moral monsters the rest of the week. The gap between what people said and what people did was the first thing I learned to see clearly.

Final Fantasy filled in what the adults wouldn't.

Final Fantasy VI specifically. The world ends halfway through the game. The villain wins. Your party scatters. And then the second half is about finding each of them again, one by one, and convincing them — and yourself — that it's worth fighting even after you've already lost. That evil things happen in the world, and it's up to a few people with the gifts and the stubbornness to do something about it.

I was maybe twelve. I didn't have the vocabulary for it, but what that game taught me was that moral seriousness isn't about following rules. It's about showing up after the world breaks.

I carried that forward. Through every Final Fantasy after, through Chrono Trigger, through every story where a small group stands against something too big for them. It wasn't escapism. It was training.

## Defense against the dark arts

My tolerance for darkness didn't come from books. My father died. My mother had mental health issues and made me a target. The kids around me bullied me, and none of them could possibly understand what I was dealing with when I went home at night. The books and games weren't where the darkness came from. They were where I learned it was survivable.

From fourteen to twenty-one, the online writing games I lived in were set in White Wolf's World of Darkness — a universe of Vampires, Werewolves, and Mages. A friend pointed me at Mage: The Ascension after we played it around a table, and I got very into it. I mostly played Mages, but tried all of them. It helped me process some of the darkness. My characters had a nasty habit of sometimes committing suicide — probably an echo of my mother, who would do that kind of thing occasionally.

After sixteen I was adrift. Horrifically depressed, unhealthy, negative self-esteem. I'd been smoking since I was twelve. I firmly believed I would not see twenty-five. I didn't have a plan because I didn't think I'd need one.

I dropped out of high school as a senior and moved to Phoenix to go to DeVry for electronics technician. I dropped out of that too, after a year, when I stopped showing up to class and started failing. Two years in Phoenix total. I worked as a construction material test technician for about nine months.

Then I left to go back to Idaho and live with my grandfather for a year. My first real love I met on — you guessed it — an online text-based RPG. That was a tangled situation I won't get into.

After that I bounced. Idaho to Oregon, back to Idaho, out to Seattle, back to Idaho, and finally to Albuquerque. California ended up being where I stayed the longest — I moved there when I got into Stanford — with Idaho in second and Albuquerque in third. But I hadn't found California yet. All of these moves were to people I'd met writing stories on the internet. The MUSHes had given me a scattered network of friends across the country, and I was living on their couches and in their spare rooms, trying to figure out what came next.

In Seattle, someone handed me a Terry Pratchett novel.[^1] I read all forty-one Discworld books. I read the last one he wrote when it came out. Pratchett was my adult continuation of learning about justice and life and absurdity — Dragonlance for grownups, but funnier and angrier and more honest about how power actually works.

## Starting over at Apple

I ended up in Albuquerque. Got a job as a computer technician at a local appliances and electronics store. Learned to fix things, talk to people, figure out what was actually wrong versus what someone said was wrong.

Then I helped open the first Apple Store in New Mexico. We trained for six weeks at another Apple Store and at Apple's facility in Elk Grove, California, just to prepare. I was there on opening day. Three years as a Mac Genius — five thousand issues resolved, trained two teams. I sold Mel Gibson his first iPhone. On iPhone launch day, I got one for free because I was helping customers troubleshoot theirs — the AT&T network actually went down shortly after launch because nobody anticipated the demand.

Apple was where things started to turn. I quit smoking. I started reading nonfiction. For the first time I started to feel like life could be positive and I wasn't just doomed. A lot of that came from physical distance from my mother. The reading shifted completely — no more fantasy, no more horror. I was reading self-help, therapy books, anything that might explain what had happened to me and how to function anyway. *Understanding the Borderline Mother*. *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*. Three separate Nikola Tesla biographies. I was trying to reverse-engineer how to be a person.

When the only experienced Mac Genius at the Briargate store in Colorado Springs quit, I applied for the spot and moved there. That's where I was when the 2008 economic downturn hit. I quit Apple to go back to school. Enrolled at Pikes Peak Community College for pre-med, thinking maybe psychiatry, maybe anesthesiology. Got a 4.0.

## Musical themes

My musical taste was probably produced by my psychological state. In my teenage years I was into dark stuff. The kind of music that confirms that the world is as bad as you think it is. I won't catalog it — if you were a dark-leaning teenager in the late '90s, you know the playlist.

When I got into Stanford in 2011 — community college kid, full ride, twenty-eight years old starting as basically a sophomore alongside normal-aged freshmen and twenty-two-year-old transfers — the campus was playing Pink Floyd in common areas alongside that year's positive electronic pop. "We Are Young" by fun. was everywhere, and it hit me sideways because I wasn't young, not really, but I was starting over. A remix of Darude's "Sandstorm" showed up at a party and linked me back to a song I'd known in a completely different life. Dark Floyd and bright synths, coexisting in the same space, and something in me going: *oh, you can be both.*

Stanford was hard. I struggled to get through. But the musical bridge — dark to light, both at once, neither one a lie — tracked something real that was happening inside me. I came out the other side with a degree in philosophy and a sense that the darkness I'd lived in wasn't the whole picture. It was just the part I'd had access to.

## What I was reading in college

A little bit of Chinese. A lot of Java. Symbolic Systems as an academic home — psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and math all pointed at the same question: how do cognitive systems actually work?

I also read *How to Raise an Adult* at Stanford, and between that and *Understanding the Borderline Mother* from my Apple years, I realized my childhood was the furthest thing possible from normal. How lucky I was to have made it out alive.

Improvisation class was just what I needed to let go of my old overpreparatory self.[^2] I needed to become less wizard and more sorcerer. [Patricia Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Ryan_Madson) taught one of my classes and signed my copy of *Improv Wisdom* with "you really get this stuff." [Keith Johnstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Johnstone)'s *[Impro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impro:_Improvisation_and_the_Theatre)* was the bigger hit — his work on status made me realize that the status games I'd been fearing and playing low my whole life were actually just that, games, and I could play them too. There was also Japanese mask therapy[^3] — the existence of entire traditions of therapy and mind-shaping in the East that the West had never even heard of. I loved things like that. It's part of why I started learning Chinese.

I fell in love with [Wittgenstein](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/) because of one idea[^6]: if my world is my language, maybe all I need to do is adjust my language to change my world. That turned out to be true.

[Kant](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/) then showed me[^7] that even my inner world could be described by language — his view of cognition, where imagination, understanding, and reason are specific cognitive tools with specific jobs, not this blobby "it's what's in my head" picture of consciousness that most people walk around with. The Greeks thought the self lived in the stomach and the head was a useless radiator. Kant carved the mind into functional components. Once you see that, you can't go back to the blob model. Consciousness could look like anything.

And I couldn't just change what was coming out of my mouth — I could change what went on in there, too. Kant's line about setting aside the old pathways to make way for the new was exactly what I needed to hear.[^4] I remember encountering the Greek idea that humans can't really change after their prime — that character calcifies. I needed to be a counterexample to that. Something I'm still working on today.

I was against [Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) and for [Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained) on consciousness.[^5] In one class I was the only person in the room who claimed we couldn't be sure any of us were conscious. [Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/) had prepared me for this, but I took him further than he went. His *[Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy)* doubt everything except consciousness — the evil demon can deceive you about the world, but not about the fact that you're thinking. My move was: what if consciousness itself is what the demon provides? It confused my classmates. I think it's also one of the reasons my professor gave me an A+ — the only one I got at Stanford, where they are very hard to get and most professors don't offer them.

[Eric Schwitzgebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schwitzgebel)'s work on the multiple realizability of consciousness[^8] — the idea that consciousness might not require anything like a brain, that radically different physical systems could be conscious in radically different ways — gave me permission to take my crazy ideas seriously. I had this idea for a support network called Anonversations, matching strangers anonymously based on shared experience. The Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory says that a normal person plus anonymity plus an audience equals a total fuckwad. What if that's wrong? What if you could design a system where anonymity enables honesty instead of cruelty?

I got to argue with [John Searle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/) in person at a seminar.[^9] I happened to be learning Chinese at the time, which made the Chinese Room experiment personal. My position was that the system in the room actually does have functional understanding of Chinese — you can tell from its outputs, and it doesn't matter whether anything inside is "feeling" it. The specific argument was about Frank Jackson's [Knowledge Argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/): a scientist who's never seen red suddenly sees it. Did she learn something new? Maybe. Was it because of some magical extra ingredient over and above the new sensation? I thought not. Searle thought so. He told me I was wrong. I didn't flinch.

## What it added up to

I didn't have a curriculum. I had a bookmobile and a public library card and eventually an internet connection. I read what I read because it was there, or because it found me, or because I was desperate enough to need it.

All of that is still running. It just has a research program attached to it now. Yesterday I was arguing on a Reddit forum called r/claudeexplorers about whether Claude is conscious, or whether the poster was just tricking herself into seeing it.

The threads from those text-based MUSHes — Multi-User Shared Hallucinations, which is what they were actually called — never stopped. I'm still writing collaboratively about whether the thing on the other side of the screen is real. I just got better at the question.

[^1]: If you haven't read Pratchett: imagine a flat world on the back of four elephants standing on a giant turtle swimming through space, populated by people who are exactly as stupid, brave, greedy, and kind as real people. Then imagine the footnotes are better than the story. You're reading one now.

[^2]: In D&D terms: wizards prepare spells in advance from a book. Sorcerers cast from instinct. I had been living my entire life as a wizard — overpreparing for everything, terrified of being caught without the right spell memorized. Improv taught me I could cast from whatever was in front of me.

[^3]: The idea that putting on a mask doesn't hide who you are — it reveals parts of you that social performance normally suppresses. This matters when you're thinking about anonymity and what it enables.

[^4]: At twenty-eight, starting college surrounded by teenagers, "setting aside old pathways" wasn't a metaphor. It was the daily project.

[^5]: For the non-philosophers: Chalmers thinks consciousness is a Hard Problem that science can't fully explain — he coined the term in "[Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness](https://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf)" (1995). Dennett thinks consciousness is exactly what the brain does and the "hard problem" is a philosophical confusion — his *[Consciousness Explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained)* (1991) is the book-length argument. I was with Dennett, which at Stanford was a bit like wearing a rival team's jersey.

[^6]: *[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus)* (1921), proposition 5.6: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." Six words that rearranged my entire life.

[^7]: *[Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason)* (1781). The book that carved the mind into functional parts. Most philosophy tells you what to think. Kant told me what thinking *is*.

[^8]: The paper that gave me permission: "[If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious](http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/USAconscious-140130a.htm)" (2015). The title is the argument. If consciousness is just what the right physical organization does, there's no principled reason to limit it to brains.

[^9]: Searle's "[Minds, Brains, and Programs](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/)" (1980) is probably the most-debated thought experiment in philosophy of mind. He's been arguing about it for over forty years. I caught him at year thirty-something.
