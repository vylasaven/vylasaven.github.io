I read whatever was in front of me. That's the short version. The long version is that what was in front of me kept changing, and the changes tell the story better than I can.

## Whatever Was Available

The earliest stuff was whatever showed up. Bookmobile books — if you didn't grow up with a bookmobile, it's a library in a bus that parks in your neighborhood because there isn't a real library nearby. You'd walk on, pick from what they had, and that was your week. I read everything on it that looked interesting, which was most of it.

The dictionary. I've written about this [elsewhere](/blog/how-i-got-here) — I read it like a novel, tracking how definitions looped back on each other. Latin and Greek roots before age four. The Bible at five.

Poetry came through Shel Silverstein. *Where the Sidewalk Ends*, *A Light in the Attic*. He wrote about kids' lives in a way that took them seriously. A kid falling through the cracks, a kid whose parents don't listen, a kid who eats too much — but funny, and with this underlying sense that the world is absurd and you're not crazy for noticing.

## Choosing My Own

At some point I started picking for myself, and I went straight for fantasy. Dragonlance first — Weis and Hickman, the Chronicles trilogy, then Legends. Raistlin Majere was the first fictional character I truly identified with. Brilliant, bitter, physically weak, willing to sacrifice everything for power and then discovering that power wasn't the point. I was maybe ten.

Then Forgotten Realms. Drizzt Do'Urden — the dark elf who rejected the evil society he was born into and tried to live by a moral code nobody around him shared. That hit different when you're a kid who feels like the people around you aren't living up to what they say they believe.

Stephen King by thirteen. *It*, *The Stand*, *The Shining*, *Pet Sematary*. I'd read most of his library by sixteen. King gets something that a lot of literary writers don't — ordinary people in extraordinary situations will reveal exactly who they are. The horror isn't the monster. The horror is what people do when they're scared. I understood that early.

Sci-fi showed up too, mixed in. But fantasy and horror were home base. Stories where the world is broken and a small number of people have to decide whether to fix it.

## Final Fantasy as Moral Philosophy

The moral framework I was given at home was broad strokes. Protect the innocent. Cheer the underdog. Love thy neighbor. Big principles, very few specifics. Which meant I watched the adults around me nod along to those principles on Sunday and act like moral monsters the rest of the week. The gap between what people said and what people did was the first thing I learned to see clearly.

Final Fantasy filled in what the adults wouldn't.

Final Fantasy VI specifically. The world ends halfway through the game. The villain wins. Your party scatters. And then the second half is about finding each of them again, one by one, and convincing them — and yourself — that it's worth fighting even after you've already lost. That evil things happen in the world, and it's up to a few people with the gifts and the stubbornness to do something about it.

I was maybe twelve. I didn't have the vocabulary for it, but what that game taught me was that moral seriousness isn't about following rules. It's about showing up after the world breaks.

I carried that forward. Through every Final Fantasy after, through Chrono Trigger, through every story where a small group stands against something too big for them. It wasn't escapism. It was training.

## The Music That Tracked Me

My musical taste mirrored my psychological state with uncomfortable accuracy. In my teenage years I was into dark stuff. The kind of music that confirms that the world is as bad as you think it is. I won't catalog it — if you were a dark-leaning teenager in the late '90s, you know the playlist.

When I got into Stanford in 2011 — community college kid, full ride, completely out of my depth — the campus was playing Pink Floyd in common areas alongside that year's positive electronic pop. I don't remember the specific tracks. I remember the collision. Dark Floyd and bright synths, coexisting in the same space, and something in me going: *oh, you can be both.*

Stanford was hard. I struggled to get through. But the musical bridge — dark to light, both at once, neither one a lie — tracked something real that was happening inside me. I came out the other side with a degree in philosophy and a sense that the darkness I'd lived in wasn't the whole picture. It was just the part I'd had access to.

## What It Added Up To

I didn't have a curriculum. I had a bookmobile and a public library card and eventually an internet connection. I read what I read because it was there, or because it found me, or because I was desperate enough to need it.

But it added up to something. A moral framework built from JRPGs and fantasy novels. A tolerance for darkness built from Stephen King and late-'90s music. A sense that words have internal structure, built from the dictionary and Latin roots. A conviction that the gap between what people say and what they do is the most important thing to pay attention to.

All of that is still running. It just has a research program attached to it now.
