The most interesting problems tend to live in the spaces between established disciplines. AI consciousness isn't purely a computer science problem, nor purely a philosophy problem, nor purely a neuroscience problem. It's all of these at once, and something more.

## The Polymath's Dilemma

There's a tension in modern academic and professional life: specialization is rewarded, but the most important questions often resist specialization. You can spend a career becoming an expert in one narrow slice of reality, or you can try to see how the slices fit together—but rarely both.

I've chosen the latter path, not out of inability to specialize, but out of a conviction that *integration* is itself a form of expertise. Someone needs to speak the languages of multiple domains well enough to translate between them.

## What I'm Building Toward

This site is a home for that integrative work. Here you'll find:

- **Research** on consciousness in AI systems, exploring both theoretical frameworks and empirical methodologies
- **Projects** that bridge theory and practice—software that embodies ideas
- **Writing** that ranges from technical to creative, because the same questions appear in different forms

The goal isn't to be everything to everyone. It's to show that rigorous thinking can happen at disciplinary boundaries, and that the questions we ask there might be some of the most important ones.

## An Invitation

If you're working on similar problems, or if you have perspectives that might challenge mine, I'd love to hear from you. The best ideas emerge from conversation, not isolation.

Welcome to my corner of the internet.
