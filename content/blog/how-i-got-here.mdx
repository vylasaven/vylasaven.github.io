I was reading full books at four. The Bible at five — not being read to, reading it, tracking who begat whom and why God was angry this time. Between three and five I was studying Latin and Greek word roots. *Bene* and *dictio*. *Malus* and *volens*. I liked taking words apart and finding older, simpler meanings underneath.

In sixth grade my teacher told me I could spell better than he could. I always had five books going. I'd read until the chapter ended or things got slow, then switch to a different book. I stayed up way too late most nights. Reading was my escape.

At some point I started reading the dictionary. Not looking things up — reading it, cover to cover, paying attention to how words defined other words, how definitions circled back on each other, how the whole system held itself up by its own bootstraps.

I was twelve when the internet hit. Elder millennial timing — BBSes first, then the web. I found text-based online roleplaying games where you'd write collaboratively with other people, competitively, for experience points. You had to write well or you'd lose. That was my writing education.

## The Long Way Around

My path doesn't read like a career plan. It reads like a person following curiosity through whatever door opened next.

Computer technician first. Apple Mac Genius, 2006. Three years diagnosing broken machines and training people. Good at it, but it wasn't the thing.

Then back to community college — Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs — for pre-med. Psychiatry, maybe anesthesiology. I wanted to know how consciousness flickers on and off, what it means to put someone under and bring them back. Got a 4.0.

Then Stanford happened. Full ride. Philosophy with a Symbolic Systems emphasis — the study of how minds, machines, and language interact. CS, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, all at once. Also a Certificate in Global Human Rights, because the question of what we owe each other kept showing up everywhere.

## Ocean Robots, Mining Trucks, Warships

After Stanford I went to Liquid Robotics. Autonomous ocean robots called Wave Gliders. I started on the night shift doing mission support — babysitting robots crossing the Pacific, making sure they didn't drift off course. Boeing bought the company. Over seven years I went from night-shift mission support to QA to team lead. Won a Boeing Award for Technical Achievement.

Same question the whole time: is this system doing what it should? When the robot says it's at 23.4N 154.2W, is it actually there?

Two years at SafeAI after that. Senior Software QA Engineer testing autonomy kits retrofitted onto 200-ton mining trucks. Load-haul-dump cycles all day, simulation and field. You're testing whether the truck stops when it should stop.

Now Saronic Technologies. Autonomous surface vessels. I came in as a test engineer, built a full-stack quality platform by orchestrating AI agents in nine months, got promoted to Software Quality Manager. Verifying whether an AI agent wrote correct code turns out to be the same problem as verifying whether an autonomous vessel is following its route. Is the output meaningful, or is it noise?

## The Idea That Wouldn't Stop

Between Boeing and SafeAI I took five months off. For years I'd been talking to everyone I knew — friends, family, coworkers, whoever would listen — about this idea for a support network. You'd match with someone based on shared experience. Not a therapist. Not a hotline. Just another person who'd been through the thing you're going through, and you could talk to them anonymously. I described it so many times that it eventually became: just build the thing.

I called it Anonversations. Built it in Swift 5 for iOS, no AI, just me and Xcode. Five months on savings got me to a barely-working prototype. You could sign up, set your areas of experience, queue for a match. But real-time chat and matching infrastructure from scratch, alone — that was the wall. The app didn't have working chat. I shelved it and went back to work.

When Claude Sonnet 3.5 came out, everything changed. I rebuilt it in React Native with Firebase. 90+ screens, matching logic, anonymous auth, 150+ Cloud Functions. The thing I couldn't build alone in five months I could now architect and direct agents to build with me.

## The Dictionary Thing, Again

I run an independent research program alongside all of this. Five projects, one question: is the meaning real?

The one called the Semantic Compiler connects most directly to the kid studying Latin roots and reading the dictionary. Dictionary writers use simpler words to define complex ones. They converge toward a small set of basic concepts — linguists call them semantic primitives. Things like SOMEONE, DO, KNOW, WANT, GOOD, BAD, BECAUSE. My bet is that convergence isn't random. It's structure, and structure is computable. I'm testing that right now, and the early numbers are promising.

## The Pattern

The three-year-old studying Latin roots was noticing that words have internal structure. The kid reading the dictionary noticed that definitions do too. The QA engineer testing ocean robots kept asking whether system outputs carry real signal. The guy who wouldn't shut up about Anonversations was betting that shared experience has transferable structure. The researcher building a semantic compiler is trying to formalize all of it.

I didn't plan this. I just kept following the question.
